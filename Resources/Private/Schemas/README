November 1st, 2013:

ViewHelper namespaces have been moved from the fedext.net domain to the
typo3.org domain - new NS urls are used in the XSD located in this folder.

To migrate, simply change your XSD namespace URL mappings to point to:

http://typo3.org/ns/$extensionKey

This change unifies our namespaces with those used in the core for
better transparency.
